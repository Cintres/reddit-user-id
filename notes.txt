Stylometry:
-Most systems based on lexical statistics
-Common words (stop words) are actually more interesting
than less frequent topical words

-Writer invariant: property of a text which is invariant of its author
  common properties: dist. of word lengths, sentence length,
  avg word length, vocab richness, frequency of function words,
  vocab richness, etc.

  -avg. sentence length and avg. word length not very useful
  -best is analysis of function words b/c used by authors subconsciously

-One method: find frequency of (20-50) most common words in anonymous text.
      The 50 dimensional vectors are then flattened into a plane with PCA.
      If two works are placed on the same plane, they are likely to have
      the same author.

-Rare Pairs: technique for identifying style based on collocation.
  collocation: word sequences appear more often than just by chance

-Punctuation use a good indicator as well

1.)
Mendenhall's Characteristic Curves of Composition
  -def: word length distributions will look the same among different works of authors
  -implementation: plot the word frequencies for each given user

2.)
Kilgariff's Chi-Squared Method
    -def: most commonly used words should be used in similar frequencies
    implementation: -Oversample the anonymous text to be proportionate to the known user's corpus
                    -combine the corpora of the anonymous user with each user, one by one.
                    -Take the n most common words (n is usually 100-1000, use smaller n if
                    you have a smaller document. Or use stop words.)
                    -Calculate Ei: how frequent the word should have come up in the anonymous text
                    by dividing each frequency of n words by the size of the known corpus
                    -calculate chi-squared for each token: x^2 = sum((Ci-Ei)^2)/Ei
                    -the smaller the chi value, the more similar the two corpora
