Stylometry:
-Most systems based on lexical statistics
-Common words (stop words) are actually more interesting
than less frequent topical words

-Writer invariant: property of a text which is invariant of its author
  common properties: dist. of word lengths, sentence length,
  avg word length, vocab richness, frequency of function words,
  vocab richness, etc.

  -avg. sentence length and avg. word length not very useful
  -best is analysis of function words b/c used by authors subconsciously

-One method: find frequency of (20-50) most common words in anonymous text.
      The 50 dimensional vectors are then flattened into a plane with PCA.
      If two works are placed on the same plane, they are likely to have
      the same author.

-Rare Pairs: technique for identifying style based on collocation.
  collocation: word sequences appear more often than just by chance
